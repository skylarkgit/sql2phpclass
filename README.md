# sql2phpclass
You can use these scripts to generate php classes by just defining the database in .dtf format (no, it's not a standard). This python scripts is developed in order to take the previous closed and deprecated projects like db2php, db2class, dbClassify, sql2class etc. one step further. I aim to include features of foreign keys too (best part). I invite you, the reader to contribute.
